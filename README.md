The Directory app is designed to gather personal information from users, such as their name, date of birth, Aadhar number, and phone number. Once users provide accurate details, the application stores this data in the local storage of their device. When iterating through the local storage data, the app displays the information for each individual in the user interface. Additionally, within this application, individuals have the option to access their own details by entering their Aadhar number. To manage the application's state, the `useState` hook is utilized, and the `useEffect` hook is employed to handle side effects, like the addition of data to the local storage.
